# Hi, I'm Songwut Meesema👋

I'm a third-year Interactive and Game Design student focused on gameplay programming and system design.  
I enjoy building modular, event-driven gameplay systems in Unity (C#), and I'm particularly interested in clean architecture and maintainable code.

I'm also exploring **HLSL, Shader Graph, and technical art workflows**, aiming to bridge gameplay systems and visual presentation.

Outside of development, I'm a huge fan of  **TRPGs**. I love system-driven storytelling and enjoy socializing with people.
